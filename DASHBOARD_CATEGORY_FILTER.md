# Dashboard Category Filter Implementation

## Overview

Added category filtering to the Sales Dashboard, allowing users to filter all sales data by product category. This enables focused analysis of specific product lines.

## Features

### 1. Category Filter Dropdown

- **Location**: Header area, next to Month and Year selectors
- **Default**: "All Categories" (shows all sales data)
- **Options**: All available product categories from the database
- **Icon**: Tag icon to indicate category filtering

### 2. Enhanced Filter UI

- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Tag icon in category dropdown
  - Calendar icon in month dropdown
  - Active category badge in header subtitle
- **Styling**:
  - Consistent border and rounded corners
  - Dark mode support
  - Hover and focus states
  - Minimum width for better readability

### 3. Data Filtering Logic

When a category is selected, **all dashboard data** is filtered:

- ✅ **Total Revenue** - Only from selected category
- ✅ **Today's Sales** - Category-specific
- ✅ **Month Orders** - Orders containing category items
- ✅ **Average Order Value** - Based on filtered orders
- ✅ **Daily Sales Chart** - Daily revenue from category
- ✅ **Monthly Revenue Chart** - Year-long category trends
- ✅ **Top Products** - Top sellers within category
- ✅ **Payment Methods** - Payment distribution for category sales
- ✅ **Recent Transactions** - Recent orders with category items

### 4. Filter Implementation

```javascript
// Filter receipts by category
if (selectedCategory !== "all") {
  receipts = receipts.filter((receipt) => {
    if (receipt.lineItems && Array.isArray(receipt.lineItems)) {
      return receipt.lineItems.some((item) => {
        // Check if any line item belongs to the selected category
        return item.category_id === selectedCategory;
      });
    }
    return false;
  });
}
```

**Key Points**:

- Filters at the receipt level
- Receipt is included if **any** line item matches the category
- Preserves multi-category orders (order with mixed categories included if it contains the selected category)

## UI/UX Details

### Filter Controls Layout

```
Desktop: [Category ▼] [Month ▼] [Year ▼]
Mobile:  [Category ▼]
         [Month ▼]
         [Year ▼]
```

### Active Filter Badge

When a category is selected:

```
Sales Dashboard
Candy Kush POS - Sales Analytics [🏷️ Flower]
```

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile**: Filters stack vertically with full width
- **Desktop**: Filters displayed horizontally in a row
- Icons and text scale appropriately

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.js`

### New Imports

```javascript
import { categoriesService } from "@/lib/firebase/firestore";
import { Filter, Tag } from "lucide-react";
```

### New State Variables

```javascript
const [categories, setCategories] = useState([]);
const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState("all");
```

### Load Categories on Mount

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadCategories();
}, []);

const loadCategories = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await categoriesService.getAll();
    setCategories(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error loading categories:", error);
  }
};
```

### Reload Data on Filter Change

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (categories.length > 0) {
    loadDashboardData();
  }
}, [selectedMonth, selectedYear, selectedCategory, categories]);
```

## User Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Dashboard shows "All Categories" data
2. **Select Category**: User chooses a specific category from dropdown
3. **Auto-Refresh**: Dashboard instantly reloads with filtered data
4. **Visual Feedback**: Category badge appears in header
5. **Reset**: Select "All Categories" to view all data again

## Benefits

### Business Intelligence

- **Category Performance**: See which product lines drive revenue
- **Seasonal Trends**: Track category-specific seasonal patterns
- **Inventory Planning**: Identify slow/fast-moving categories
- **Marketing Insights**: Focus campaigns on underperforming categories

### User Experience

- **Quick Insights**: No need to export data for category analysis
- **Real-time Filtering**: Instant data refresh on filter change
- **Clear Indication**: Always know which filter is active
- **Consistent Pattern**: Same filter behavior across date ranges

## Data Accuracy Notes

### Mixed-Category Orders

When an order contains items from multiple categories:

- The order **is included** if any item matches the selected category
- Revenue is counted in full (not just the category items)
- This reflects real-world business: cross-selling effects

### Example:

```
Order #123: Total ฿500
- Item A (Flower category): ฿300
- Item B (Edibles category): ฿200

When filtering by "Flower":
- Order #123 included: ✅
- Revenue counted: ฿500 (full order)

When filtering by "Edibles":
- Order #123 included: ✅
- Revenue counted: ฿500 (full order)
```

> **Note**: This means category revenue may overlap when summed separately, but provides accurate business context (total order value when category was purchased).

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- [ ] Multiple category selection (filter by 2+ categories)
- [ ] "Pure category" mode (only orders with exclusively one category)
- [ ] Category comparison view (side-by-side)
- [ ] Export filtered data to CSV
- [ ] Save favorite filter combinations
- [ ] Category revenue as % of total
- [ ] Category growth rate comparison

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. ✅ Select "All Categories" - Shows all data
2. ✅ Select specific category - Filters all metrics
3. ✅ Change month while category filtered - Maintains filter
4. ✅ Change year while category filtered - Maintains filter
5. ✅ Switch between categories - Updates correctly
6. ✅ Category badge shows correct name
7. ✅ Dark mode styling works
8. ✅ Mobile responsive layout

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome ✅
- Firefox ✅
- Safari ✅
- Edge ✅
- Mobile browsers ✅

## Deployment Notes

**No database changes required** - uses existing category data from Loyverse sync.

**Cache considerations**:

- Clear browser cache if categories don't appear
- Ensure Loyverse sync has run at least once
- Categories come from `categoriesService.getAll()`

## Support

If categories don't appear:

1. Check Integration page - sync categories from Loyverse
2. Verify categories exist in Products > Categories
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure Firebase connection is active
