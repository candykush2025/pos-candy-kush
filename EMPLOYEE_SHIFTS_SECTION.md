## Tips for Employees

1. **Review After Each Shift**: Check your shift record after logout to verify accuracy
2. **Track Patterns**: Notice if discrepancies happen at specific times
3. **Report Issues**: If you notice errors in the system, notify manager
4. **Maintain Accuracy**: Use the variance preview when ending shifts to avoid surprises

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No shifts found"
