## Stock Movement Logic

When initial stock is added:

- If stock = 0: No movement recorded
- If stock > 0:
  - Type: "purchase"
  - From: 0
  - To: Initial stock quantity
  - Cashier: Current logged-in cashier
  - Note: "Initial stock from POS"

This provides audit trail showing:

- Who added the stock
- When it was added
- Initial quantity

## Best Practices

### SKU Management

- Let system auto-generate SKUs
- Keep SKUs sequential
- Don't reuse deleted SKUs
- Use SKU as primary identifier

### Stock Tracking

- Enable for physical products
- Set realistic low stock thresholds
- Review low stock alerts daily
- Update stock after receiving shipments

### Images

- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Square images work best
- Compress before upload
- Use colors for simple items

### Pricing

- Always set cost for profit tracking
- Update prices regularly
- Consider setting minimum stock for popular items

## Troubleshooting

### Image Won't Upload

- Check file size (must be < 5MB)
- Check file type (must be image)
- Try compressing image first
- Try different format (JPG instead of PNG)

### SKU Conflicts

- SKUs must be unique
- System prevents duplicates
- Edit SKU manually if needed
- Check existing products first

### Stock Not Tracking

- Ensure "Track Stock" toggle is ON
- Both In Stock and Low Stock required
- Values must be numbers
- Cannot be negative

### Category Not Available

- Categories created in admin panel
- Must have at least one category
- Contact admin if missing categories
