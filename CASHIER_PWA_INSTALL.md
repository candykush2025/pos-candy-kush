# Cashier PWA Installation Guide

This guide is for **cashiers only**. The Candy Kush POS can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for faster performance and offline access.

> **Note for Admins**: Admin users should use the regular browser to access admin features. Do NOT install the PWA for admin work.

## Why Install PWA for Cashiers?

- ⚡ **Faster Performance**: Instant loading after installation
- 📱 **App-like Experience**: Works like a native mobile/desktop app
- 🔒 **Focused Workspace**: No browser tabs or distractions
- 💾 **Better Caching**: Products and settings load faster
