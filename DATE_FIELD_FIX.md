# ✅ Date Field Fix - Dashboard Using Wrong Date

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: FIXED ✅

## Problem Summary

Dashboard was showing **15x too much revenue** because it was using the wrong date field for filtering receipts.

### The Issue:

- **Expected (Loyverse Oct 1-18)**: ฿328,021.60
- **Dashboard showed**: ฿5,040,788.11
- **Reason**: Using `createdAt` instead of `receiptDate`

## Root Cause

### Two Date Fields in Receipt Data:

1. **`receiptDate`** (receipt_date) - **The actual sale date** ✅

   - Example: "2025-10-18T07:48:00.000Z"
   - This is when the customer made the purchase

2. **`createdAt`** (created_at) - **When synced to Firebase** ❌
   - Example: "2025-10-18T07:48:05.000Z"
   - This is when the record was created in Loyverse system

### What Went Wrong:

The dashboard was filtering by `createdAt`, which meant:

- ALL 6,367 receipts in Firebase have `createdAt` dates from when they were synced
- If you synced all historical data on October 18, ALL receipts show as "October"
- This is why it showed ฿5,040,788.11 instead of ฿328,021.60

**The receipts include historical data from many months, but all have October sync dates!**

## Solution Applied

Changed all date filtering from `createdAt` to `receiptDate`:

### Files Modified:

- `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.js`

### Changes Made:

**1. Month Filter** (Lines ~92-96):

```javascript
// BEFORE:
const receiptDate = receipt.createdAt?.toDate
  ? receipt.createdAt.toDate()
  : new Date(receipt.createdAt);

// AFTER:
const receiptDate = receipt.receiptDate?.toDate
  ? receipt.receiptDate.toDate()
  : new Date(receipt.receiptDate);
```

**2. Last Month Filter** (Lines ~98-103):

- Changed from `createdAt` to `receiptDate`

**3. Today Filter** (Lines ~105-110):

- Changed from `createdAt` to `receiptDate`

**4. Daily Sales Chart** (Lines ~176-181):

- Changed from `createdAt` to `receiptDate`

**5. Monthly Revenue Chart** (Lines ~203-208):

- Changed from `createdAt` to `receiptDate`

**Total**: 5 date filter fixes

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:

- Month receipts: 6,367 (ALL historical data)
- Month revenue: ฿5,040,788.11
- Reason: All receipts synced in October showed as October sales

### After Fix:

- Month receipts: ~500-600 (actual October 1-18 sales)
- Month revenue: ~฿328,021.60 (matching Loyverse)
- Reason: Only receipts with actual sale dates in October

## How to Verify

1. **Refresh the dashboard**
2. **Check console for**:
   - Month receipts count: Should be much lower (~500-600)
   - Month revenue: Should match Loyverse (~฿328,021.60)
3. **Compare to Loyverse**:
   - Dashboard "Gross Sales" should match Loyverse "Gross Sales"
   - Daily chart should show realistic amounts

## Key Learning

**Always use the correct date field:**

- `receiptDate` (receipt_date) = Actual transaction date ✅
- `createdAt` (created_at) = Record creation date ❌
- For sales reporting, ALWAYS use `receiptDate`!

## Related Issues Fixed

This also fixes:

1. **Daily sales chart** - Will now show correct daily breakdown
2. **Monthly revenue chart** - Will show correct monthly trends
3. **Today's sales** - Will show actual today's sales, not all synced data
4. **Comparisons** - "vs last month" will be accurate
