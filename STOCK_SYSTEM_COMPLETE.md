});

await stockHistoryService.logStockMovement({

  referenceType: "purchase_order",
});
```

### 3. Stock Adjustments

});
```

### 4. Sales (NEW! ‚úÖ)

  if (product && product.trackStock) {
    const newStock = Math.max(0, currentStock - item.quantity);

    // Update stock
    await productsService.update(product.id, {
      stock: newStock,
    });

    // Log history
