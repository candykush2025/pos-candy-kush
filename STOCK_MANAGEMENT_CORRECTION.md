# Stock Management Location Correction

## Overview

Moved stock management functionality from the products page to its own dedicated admin section at `/admin/stock`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Stock Management Page (`/src/app/admin/stock/page.js`)

- **Before**: Old Loyverse sync implementation (498 lines)
- **After**: Clean stock management system with 3-tab interface (78 lines)
- **Features**:
  - Purchase Orders tab
  - Stock Adjustment tab
  - Stock History tab
- **Route**: Accessible at `/admin/stock` via existing "Stock" menu item in admin layout

### 2. Products Page (`/src/app/admin/products/items/page.js`)

- **Removed**:
  - Stock management submenu navigation
  - Unused imports: `PurchaseOrdersSection`, `StockAdjustmentSection`, `StockHistorySection`
  - Unused icons: `ShoppingCart`, `ClipboardList`, `History`, `TrendingUp`, `TrendingDown`
  - `activeSubmenu` state
  - Conditional rendering of stock sections
- **Updated**:
  - Page title: "Stock Management" → "Product Management"
  - Page description: "Manage your product inventory and stock levels" → "Manage your product inventory and information"
- **Kept**:
  - Stock history logging on product creation (still works correctly)
  - All product CRUD functionality

## File Structure

```
/admin/stock (Stock Management - NEW LOCATION)
├── Purchase Orders
├── Stock Adjustment
└── Stock History

/admin/products/items (Product Management - CLEANED UP)
├── Product List
├── Add/Edit Product
└── Product Details
```

## Admin Navigation

The admin layout already had a "Stock" menu item pointing to `/admin/stock`:

```javascript
{ name: "Stock", href: "/admin/stock", icon: Database }
```

This now correctly shows the stock management system with purchase orders, adjustments, and history.

## Integration Points

### Product Creation → Stock History

- When a product is created with `trackStock=true` and `stock > 0`
- Automatically logs initial stock in `stockHistory` collection
- Location: `/admin/products/items/page.js` in `handleSubmit` function

### Purchase Orders → Stock Updates

- When a PO is marked as "Received"
- Updates product stock quantity
- Logs movement in stock history with type='purchase_order'
- Location: `/components/admin/stock/PurchaseOrdersSection.jsx`

### Stock Adjustments → Stock Updates

- Manual add/decrease of stock with reason
- Updates product stock quantity
- Logs movement in stock history with type='adjustment'
- Location: `/components/admin/stock/StockAdjustmentSection.jsx`

### Sales → Stock Deduction (PENDING)

- TODO: Integrate with receipt/sales processing
- When sale completed, decrease stock and log with type='sale'

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/stock`
- [ ] Verify all 3 tabs display correctly
- [ ] Create a purchase order
- [ ] Mark purchase order as received
- [ ] Check stock was updated on product
- [ ] Verify history logged in Stock History tab
- [ ] Create a stock adjustment
- [ ] Verify adjustment logged in history
- [ ] Create a new product with stock
- [ ] Verify initial stock logged in history
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/products/items`

- [ ] Verify product creation still works

## Benefits

✅ **Clear Separation**: Products and stock operations are now in separate sections
✅ **Better UX**: Users know where to go for stock vs. product management
✅ **Cleaner Code**: Removed 600+ lines of duplicated stock management code from products page
✅ **Proper Architecture**: Stock operations centralized in one location
✅ **Maintained Functionality**: All features still work, just better organized

## Next Steps

1. Test the stock management pages thoroughly
2. Integrate sales stock deduction when receipts are created
3. Consider adding low stock alerts/notifications
4. Add stock reports and analytics
