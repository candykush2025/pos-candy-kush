## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000
npm run dev
```

### Dependencies not installed

```bash
npm install
```

### Build errors

```bash
# Clear cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### IndexedDB not working

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure using modern browser
- Check browser settings allow IndexedDB

## Development Tips

- Use React DevTools for debugging
- Check Network tab for API calls
- Use Application tab to inspect IndexedDB
- Console shows sync status
- Hot reload enabled (edit and save)

## File Locations

- **Components**: `src/components/`
- **State**: `src/store/`
- **API**: `src/lib/api/`
