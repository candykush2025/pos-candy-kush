# Payment Types Integration - POS Sales

## Overview

The POS Sales section now supports **4 different payment types** that sync correctly with Loyverse:

1. **Cash** - Traditional cash payments
2. **Card** - Non-integrated card terminal payments
3. **Crypto transfer** - Cryptocurrency payments
4. **Transfer** - Bank transfer payments

Each payment type has its unique ID from your Loyverse account and syncs properly when creating receipts.

## Payment Types Configuration

```javascript
// Located in: src/config/constants.js

### 3. Loyverse Sync Integration

**How it works:**

1. **Payment Selection:** User selects payment type
2. **Payment Type Lookup:** System maps selected method to Loyverse payment type
3. **Receipt Creation:** Creates receipt with correct `payment_type_id`
4. **Loyverse Sync:** Sends to Loyverse API with proper payment type
5. **Receipt Storage:** Saves to Firebase with payment type name

**Code Flow:**

```javascript
// User selects payment method
paymentMethod = "crypto"; // or "cash", "card", "transfer"

// System looks up Loyverse payment type
selectedPaymentType = LOYVERSE_PAYMENT_TYPES.CRYPTO;
// {
//   id: "d8139062-22ed-4e16-a565-0a1fead90c70",
//   name: "Crypto transfer",
//   type: "OTHER"
// }

// Creates Loyverse receipt with correct payment type
loyverseData = {
  ...receiptData,
  payments: [
    {
      payment_type_id: "d8139062-22ed-4e16-a565-0a1fead90c70", // Correct ID
      paid_at: "2024-10-14T12:30:00.000Z",
    },
  ],
};

// Syncs to Loyverse
loyverseService.createReceipt(loyverseData);
```

### 4. Receipt Display

**Receipt Modal:**

- Shows payment type name (e.g., "Crypto transfer" instead of "crypto")
- Displays cash received and change for cash payments
- Shows total amount for non-cash payments

**Thermal Receipt:**

### Loyverse Sync Verification

For each payment type, verify in Loyverse:

1. Go to Loyverse dashboard
2. Navigate to Receipts
3. Find the synced receipt
4. **Verify:**
   - Receipt number matches POS
   - Payment type is correct (Cash/Card/Crypto/Transfer)
   - Amount is correct
   - Store ID matches
   - Sync status is "synced" in POS

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Wrong payment type in Loyverse

**Solution:** Check that payment type IDs in `constants.js` match your Loyverse account.

1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Integration page
2. Click "Get Payment Types"
3. Find your payment types
4. Copy the correct IDs
5. Update `LOYVERSE_PAYMENT_TYPES` in `constants.js`

### Issue: Payment type not syncing

**Possible Causes:**

- Internet connection offline
- Invalid payment type ID
- Loyverse API error

**Debug Steps:**

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify payment type ID is correct
3. Check sync status in receipt details
4. Look at `syncError` field in Firebase

### Issue: Receipt shows "undefined" payment type

**Solution:** Old receipts don't have `paymentTypeName` field.

**Fix:** The code has fallback logic:

```jsx
{
  completedOrder.paymentTypeName || completedOrder.paymentMethod;
}
```

For new receipts, this won't be an issue.
